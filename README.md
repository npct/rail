# Estimating cycling potential to rail stations

The goal of this repo is to explore methods for calculating cycling
potential to public transport nodes, rail stations in the first
instance.

# OD data

The input data consists of origin-destination pairs. These can be
obtained from a range of sources. We will use open OD data from the 2011
UK Census to demonstrate the methods. A random sample of OD pairs from
the national dataset is shown below.
